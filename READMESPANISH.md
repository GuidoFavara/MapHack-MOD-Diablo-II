If you want you can see this Readme in [Spanish] (https://github.com/GuidoFavara/MapHack-MOD-Diablo-II/blob/master/READMESPANISH.md)

I have been making some improvements to the Open Source MapHack of [Slash Diablo] (https://github.com/planqi/slashdiablo-maphack) that I think would be good for all users, this version comes to implement improvements and helps the user mainly to time to play tournaments and PVP

These implementations were initially intended to be applied to the [Ombu Diablo II Server](https://foros.ombuserver.com.ar/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=254), however by putting the source it could apply to anyone, it would only be necessary to change the names of specific files

The UI.Dll is no longer used, now everything goes in Ombu_Settings.cfg for simple editing (the ui.dll that each one has can be copied into this new file).

I detail some of the improvements:
* "Spam" that indicates where to click on the game to make donations to the server.

* Approximate value of each item according to the current price list made by users (not official). The MH when entering a game notifies that the prices are as a REFERENCE not to be taken as is (to avoid problems).

* Indicate what items you need to craft.

* Indicate what items you need to upgrade the item in question.

* Indicates that RW's can be assembled on the base.

* Indicate what items you need to upload the rune.

* The ears are not visible (item that indicates that a player killed you).

* Includes Spanish translations of various options provided by Slash.

Improvements and helps in PVP:
* Improved table template with recommendations (useful for novice users), indicates how many resistances are "acceptable" and allowed according to server rules, breaks and much more. It also calculates it for you at the moment, if you add resistance it tells you how much you need to have the "ideal".

* Referee Mode: Best of all

* Indicates when a user uses Potions of Life or Mana, uses Auras not allowed or uses Temples.
For this to work, it is NOT necessary for everyone to have the updated MH, a user with an old MH can be detected by a user with the new MH, this is because the packets sent to the server are intercepted and returned in text format (notification) .



* The notification appears to every user who owns my version of the MH.

* Users do not need to be "close" for this notification to appear, it means that as long as they are both in act 1, it will appear that they potted or did something not allowed.

* It has an activator to avoid the flood to those who do not like it or especially if it is used in bh, an annoying and useless notification for that area does not appear

You can search for the changes made (CTRL + F) in the solution by writing my name (guido) it is all commented.

TODO:
I would like to implement remaining time counter in buffs
